Android App for uploading photos to cloud storage quickly

---

##Objective

To design an Android app purely around my laziness. 
This app will allow users to take a picture (or multiple pictures) with their Android phones and immediatley upload them to their chosen Cloud storage. 
They will be able to upload it to common cloud storage services, specifically Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox.
